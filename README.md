# ESP32 NimBLE Keyboard library

Changed the original [ESP32-BLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) to support NimBLE.

Update [SP32-NimBLE-Keyboard](https://github.com/wakwak-koba/ESP32-NimBLE-Keyboard) to support NimBLE version 2.3.4.

This library allows you to make the ESP32 act as a Bluetooth Keyboard and control what it does.
